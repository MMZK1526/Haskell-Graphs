# Haskell-Graphs
Implements graph-related algorithms in Haskell.  
Based on the Imperial College First-Year Course: 40008 Graphs and Algorithms. 
(Just starting, I'll add algorithms as the course goes on)  
For a quick guide on the algorithms, check out Example.hs  

# Graph.hs
Implements graph using adjacency matrix and adjacency list   
Provides a type class for graphs  

# Search
Implements Depth-First Search & Breadth-First Search (TODO)  
Generate spanning trees and computes depth of each node given the root
